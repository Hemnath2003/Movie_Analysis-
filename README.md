Introduction
In this project, we explore a movie dataset to uncover insights about the film industry. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful patterns and trends. The primary tools used are Python and various data science libraries, facilitated through Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes of movies such as title, genre, release date, budget, revenue, and ratings. The data was sourced from Dataset Source (replace with actual source or remove this line if not applicable).

Installation
To run the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-data-analysis.git
cd movie-data-analysis
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook to explore the analysis.

Analysis Overview
The analysis is divided into the following sections:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values
Data type conversions
Removing duplicates
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summary
Distribution of movie genres
Trends in release dates and revenues
Visualization:

Box plots and histograms for revenue analysis
Genre distribution charts
Time series analysis of release trends
Visualizations
Here are some key visualizations from the analysis:

1. Revenue Distribution by Genre

2. Number of Movies Released Over Time

3. Budget vs. Revenue Scatter Plot
